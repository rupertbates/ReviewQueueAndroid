[{"MusicTypes":[{"Id":5}],"Title":"Coldplay – review","StandFirst":"Royal Court, Liverpool","TrailText":"With a procession of special guests and childlike enthusiasm in the crowd, there was a panto atmosphere on show after all in this gig for homeless charity Crisis, says <strong>Dave Simpson</strong>","Body":"<p>\"If anyone's here for the pantomime I'm afraid you're gonna have a shit evening,\" quips Chris Martin, kicking off the first of two gigs for homeless charity Crisis, in \"intimate\" venues. \"Intimate\", of course, is a relative concept, but a 1,000-capacity theatre is a small gig for a group who've shifted 50m albums and treat the venue like an arena. The drum sound alone seems to come via the Mersey tunnel.</p><p>Coldplay's last album, Vive le Vida, suggests they may now be the world's biggest-selling band, and while U2 and the Stones may still be ahead in tour receipts, Martin's troops are a formidable live act. The £50 tickets (unfortunately touted for 15 times as much) get you a set of greatest hits and songs they haven't played in years, and an evening somewhere between Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Elton John and Anfield. In My Place raises hands in the air within 30 seconds; the crowd bellow Yellow so loudly Martin can barely get a word in.</p><p>Wearing unfeasibly tight trousers and a carnation, the thirtysomething singer is part consummate frontman, part someone stumbling on stage at a wedding party. On record, he can be overearnest; live, he is a hoot, smashing mic stands, accidentally headbutting the microphone, claiming to be listening to Radio 4 through his headphones, and insisting the band are too embarrassed to play anything from their forthcoming fifth album because it is \"atrocious\". However, they can unleash considerable emotion, not least when the crowd form a hushed choir as Fix You unshowily but poignantly captures the point of the evening.</p><p>Martin may wish to come over like a hapless Mr Bean, but he clearly has powers beyond even the average rock god. \"If only the pantomime genie could magic up the greatest songwriter in Britain,\" he sighs, and lo and behold on walks Take That's Gary Barlow for a version of Back for Good, which generates such hysteria you fear for the building. The surreal cast is then joined by Peter Kay, hurling sweets, and no fewer than three Elvises, playing violins.</p><p>But perhaps the most significant moment came earlier, when the Choir With No Name – singers of varying ability drawn from \"the fringes of society\" – brought cheers to the rafters with their heroic, moving renditions of Christmas classics. Meanwhile, the £250,000 raised by these gigs has already established a Crisis centre in Liverpool: while governments do nothing, or worse, it seems that extraordinary events such as this can make a real difference to struggling people's lives.</p><p></p><p><em>More information at </em><a href=\"http://crisis.org.uk\" title=\"\"><em>crisis.org.uk</em></a></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n      <a href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n          <img src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\"></img>\n      </a>\n    </div><img alt='' src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Coldplay+%E2%80%93+review+Article+1496736&ch=Music&c2=&c4=Coldplay%2CPop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Dave+Simpson&c7=10-Dec-20&c8=1496736&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2010/dec/20/coldplay-review|2010-12-20T14:15:20Z|559f4a3e95239079e9fc080dfec906bc6af3625b -->","PublicationDate":"2010-12-20T12:50:24","ReviewType":{},"StarRating":4,"WebUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/dec/20/coldplay-review","Thumbnail":null,"Id":134},{"MusicTypes":[{"Id":5}],"Title":"Saint Etienne – review","StandFirst":"Forum, London","TrailText":"Cracknell, Stanley and Wiggs rustled up some Christmas magic despite a melancholic chill in the air, writes <strong>Caroline Sullivan</strong>","Body":"<p>Saint Etienne played their last show of the year on the kind of London night that probably inspired some of their songs: fresh snowfall had already turned into sooty slush, and outside the Forum a group of under-dressed smokers looked grimly stoic. Inside, where the temperature had just about hit double figures, the trio took their time coming on stage, and who could blame them? If we're to believe the sleevenotes to their new festive album, A Glimpse of Stocking, they are wholehearted fans of Christmas, but the atmosphere approximated that melancholy hour late on 25 December when the festivities are indubitably over.</p><p>Somehow, though, between the three of them – plus achingly high-spirited video footage of 1960s London, which was the starting point for their sound back in 1990 – a bit of Yuletide magic was achieved. True to previous form, sequin-skirted Sarah Cracknell made a fairly tepid frontwoman, and synth-players Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs were anonymous silhouettes in the shadows behind her. But the sweet kick of the music, with its sweeping strings and icing-sugar melodies, was enormously seductive.</p><p>The set was full of hits (they've had more than you'd think, from the deceptively lightweight Only Love Can Break Your Heart to the incongruously Latinate Like a Motorway) but it was the lesser-knowns that really registered. Girl VII proved a showpiece as Cracknell recited a list of the capital's least glamorous places (\"Old Ford, Kennington, Dollis Hill\") over a flute-filled tune that could have come from a 70s travelogue; new single DJ picked and probed at the bones of late-80s trance, complete with footage of overly refreshed ravers. Chris Rea's Driving Home for Christmas and their own I Was Born on Christmas Day (\"Julian Assange was going to sing on this, but he couldn't make it,\" Cracknell joked feebly) made a satisfying ending to an evening of low-key pleasures.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n      <a href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n          <img src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\"></img>\n      </a>\n    </div><img alt='' src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Saint+Etienne+%E2%80%93+review+Article+1496516&ch=Music&c2=&c4=Saint+Etienne%2CPop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CIndie+%28music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Caroline+Sullivan&c7=10-Dec-19&c8=1496516&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2010/dec/19/saint-etienne-review|2010-12-20T14:15:20Z|cafd8e77a370461ff0db47b61c02bc63b073b747 -->","PublicationDate":"2010-12-19T22:30:02","ReviewType":{},"StarRating":4,"WebUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/dec/19/saint-etienne-review","Thumbnail":null,"Id":130},{"MusicTypes":[{"Id":1}],"Title":"The Sixteen/Christophers – review","StandFirst":"Barbican Hall, London","TrailText":"Conductor and choir were bristling with as much energy as ever, but this Messiah took time to settle, writes <strong>Martin Kettle</strong>","Body":"<p>One can imagine a more dramatic Messiah than Harry Christophers and the Sixteen provided in the Barbican's rather dry acoustic, but across large stretches of Handel's great score it would be hard to imagine a more beautiful one.</p><p>Not that Christophers is an ascetic. Far from it. His Messiah always bristles with dancing energy, as well as unfolding organically from one number into the next. There were plenty of expressive and even romantic gestures in this account, too, typified by some rather soupy phrasing in the overture and by a very striking broadening of the first syllable of the \"Wonderful\" outburst in&nbsp;For Unto Us a Child Is Born. And Christophers always has a trump card in the shape of his outstanding chorus – 18 of them rather than 16 – whose warm sound and technical security provided the rock upon which Messiah rests.</p><p>For all the conductor's cajolings, this Messiah took time to settle. The first part of Handel's oratorio had many fine moments, among which James Gilchrist's compellingly deliberate Comfort Ye and a scintillating Rejoice Greatly from the substitute soprano Sophie Bevan stood out. But it was not until part two, the core of the work depicting Christ's Passion and Resurrection, that the reading consistently transcended its individual numbers. Catherine Wyn-Rogers set the standard for the rest to follow with a grippingly impassioned He Was Despised, and was matched by Gilchrist's hugely engaged accounts of Christ's torments, before the corner was turned and the chorus's pivotal Lift Up Your Hearts carried things irresistibly through to the Hallelujah Chorus.</p><p>Part three did not quite succeed in maintaining this tremendously high level throughout. But Christopher Purves grabbed his moment with an irresistibly stentorian The Trumpet Shall Sound, and Handel's supreme final pages, from Worthy Is the Lamb to the Amen, were wonderfully done, bringing a tingle to the spine and a tear to the eye, as ever.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n      <a href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n          <img src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\"></img>\n      </a>\n    </div><img alt='' src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=The+Sixteen%2FChristophers+%E2%80%93+review+Article+1496507&ch=Music&c2=&c4=Classical+music+%28Music+genre%29%2CGeorge+Frideric+Handel%2CMusic%2CCulture&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Martin+Kettle&c7=10-Dec-19&c8=1496507&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2010/dec/19/the-sixteen-christophers-review|2010-12-20T14:15:20Z|a919e65d72851faa9ba22f06c61b99ea74279c9f -->","PublicationDate":"2010-12-19T21:45:00","ReviewType":{},"StarRating":4,"WebUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/dec/19/the-sixteen-christophers-review","Thumbnail":null,"Id":127},{"MusicTypes":[{"Id":5},{"Id":8}],"Title":"Michael Jackson: The Experience – review","StandFirst":"(Wii, Ubisoft, cert: 12, out now)","TrailText":"<p>A Michael Jackson dancing game celebrating the late King of Pop will appeal mainly to his fans, writes <strong>Will Freeman</strong></p>","Body":"<p>If you're a fan, it's unlikely <em>Michael Jackson: The Experience</em> will do anything but delight.

The choral and orchestral writing, especially as delivered here, have rousing climaxes that compensate for more routine Elgariana padding. Worth discovering even if it's not his top work.</p><p><strong>Vivaldi</strong> Ercole sul Termodonte. Rolando Villazón, Joyce DiDonato (soloists), Europa Galante, Fabio Biondi (direction) (Virgin Classics)</p><p>The secret here is Vivaldi's score, given a wonderfully energised performance by a cast of megastars: not just Villazón and the adored DiDonato but Diana Damrau, Philippe Jaroussky, Topi Lehtipuu too. The Venetian composer is ubiquitously popular for his <em>Four Seasons</em> but his operas, making a gradual comeback, so far remain specialist territory. His <em>Ottone in Villa</em> (Il Giardino Armonico/Giovanni Antonini), just out on Virgin Classics, is another treat.</p><p></p><p><strong>Liszt</strong> The Complete Songs - 1. Matthew Polenzani (voice), Julius Drake (piano) (Hyperion)</p><p>The start of a major cycle of Liszt's \"orphaned\" songs – the composer's own description of a neglected but substantial part of his output, full of characteristic rhapsody and poetry.

The singers will change, but pianist-curator Julius Drake will be a constant.</p><p></p><p><strong>Path</strong> Louth Contemporary Music Society LCMS (Signum Classics)</p><p>It's not obvious from the bright, abstract packaging what this CD contains. Eight of nine tracks are world premiere recordings. The title relates, obliquely, to Italian composer Luigi Nono's observation: \"There are no roads, but we must go on.\" The acoustic music, performed by the Carducci Quartet, Dublin Guitar Quartet and others, is by Dmitri Yanov-Yanovsky, Arvo Pärt, John Tavener and less familiar names. Truly a hidden gem.</p><p></p><h2>Classical DVDs<br /></h2><strong>La Bohème</strong>  Alfie Boe, Melody Moore, English National Opera, Miguel Harth-Bedoya (conductor) (Warner Classics)</p><p>Jonathan Miller's Depression-period <em>La Bohème</em> got a lukewarm reception on stage but transfers unexpectedly well to DVD. Isabella Bywater's Paris street-scene sets look cinematically realistic and the sung English, easy to hear on screen, gives exactly the immediacy Puccini's masterpiece needs. Alfie Boe excels and if not all the cast are ideal, the story is well told.</p><p></p><p><strong>Simon Boccanegra</strong> Placido Domingo, Marina Poplavskaya, Antonio Pappano (conductor), Royal Opera Chorus, Orchestra of the Royal Opera House (EMI)</p><p>Scarcely an event far from the limelight – it was one of the ROH highlights of 2010, and at the BBC Proms, too – but Domingo fans who enjoyed, or missed, the great tenor-turned-baritone singing the title role of Verdi's tragic hero will covet this live DVD recording of the Royal Opera's lavish Elijah Moshinksy staging.

But this improv trio – comprising US avant-guitarists Richard Bishop and Ben Chasny, plus untethered drummer Chris Corsano – can do more than just clear the passages bunged up by boring rock music. This succinct LP meanders spaciously and elegantly. <strong>KE</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Voice of the Seven Thunders</strong> Voice of the Seven Thunders (Tchantiler)</p><p>There is a great deal of feral psychedelic rock out there, little of which actually swings. VO7T does. Mainman Rick Tomlinson used to be known as Voice of the Seven Woods; the British folk guitarist has since had a wild electric epiphany. The resulting din is a little like a Led Zeppelin excursion to Turkey, taking in analogue ambient sounds and a great deal of hair on the way. <strong>KE</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Gayngs</strong> Relayted (Jagjaguwar)</p><p>Chromeo's <em>Fancy Footwork</em> album (2007) pioneered the latest wave of loving low-key homages to theoretically unfashionable music (in their case, pop-funk). This year's surprisingly good resurrection of a questionable sound came from Minneapolitan Ryan Olson, and a cast of characters whose fame peaks with Bon Iver. <em>Relayted</em> worships 10cc, covering Godley and Creme's \"Cry\" as a creepy emotional dirge. Sad, soft rock: who knew it could work? <strong>KE</strong></p><p></p><h2><strong>WORLD/FOLK</strong><br /></h2><strong>Bibi Tanga &amp; the Selenites</strong>  Dunya (Nat Geo)</p><p>The son of a Central African Republic diplomat, Tanga brings a cosmopolitan touch to his arthouse funk and soul. Sung in English, with the title track rapped in CAR's Sango tongue, the album's languid grooves and breezy manner give way to a disco sting in the tail. A grower. <strong>Neil Spencer</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Moussu T e Lei Jovents</strong>  Putan de Cançon (Le Chant du Monde)</p><p>The Marseille trio offer a joyous tribute to their beloved home port on a third album that tumbles between chanson, folk, flamenco and blues. The gentle joys of café life vie with the hard knocks of a maritime city where \"the names of partisans are engraved\". There's exquisite low-key playing throughout. <strong>NS</strong></p><p></p><p><strong> Various Artists</strong> Angola Soundtrack: The Unique Sounds of Luanda 1968-1976 (Analog Africa)</p><p>Since the landmark <em>Ethiopiques</em> compilations, the rediscovery of vintage African recordings has snowballed. On the other side of the continent, the late 60s and early 70s were just as groovy as Ethiopia's party years, it seems. <em>Angola Soundtrack</em> gathers together a heady set of tracks; most belie the Latin influence of Angola's Portuguese colonialists, but some – \"N 'Gui Banza Mama\" by Santos Jr, for instance – proffer rhythms that are impossible to account for. <strong>KE</strong></p><p><strong>Ballaké Sissoko/Vincent Segal</strong> Chamber Music (No Format)</p><p>This encounter between Malian kora&nbsp;player Sissoko and French cellist&nbsp;Segal was overshadowed by the Ali/Toumani kora/guitar duet, and while this is a more formal affair, once the pair warm up, say on Segal's \"Ma-Ma FC\", the interchange of instruments creates sparks. <strong>NS</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Lau vs Karine Polwart</strong>Evergreen EP (Lau)</p><p>This Scottish folk summit blends Polwart's bright vocals with the ringing Orcadian tones of Kris Drever and Lau's drama-laden strings. \"January Man\" is bleak, austere, all thorn and peat bog, while Lal Waterson's \"Midnight Feast\" evokes the tactile magic of a Highlands midsummer night. <strong>NS</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Les Shelleys </strong>Les Shelleys (Fatcat)</p><p>For fans of the home hootenanny comes this debut from LA folkies Tom Brosseau and Angela Correa. Recorded in Brosseau's kitchen to guitar and ambient noise, it's a charming meander through Guthrie, Dylan and vintage pop like \"Cocktails for Two\" and \"Green Door\", the latter accompanied by only handclaps and thigh slaps. That's lo-fi! <strong>NS</strong></p><p></p><h2><strong>JAZZ</strong><br /></h2><strong>Stacey Kent</strong> Raconte-moi… (Blue Note)</p><p>This album of chansons, sung entirely in French by the American Kent and with only the subtlest of jazz flavourings, was received here with puzzled respect, but with delight by her huge following in France. Beautifully performed, and produced with his customary flair by Jim Tomlinson. <strong>Dave Gelly</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Deep Schrott</strong> One (Edition)</p><p>Weirdly endearing: four bass saxophones crunch their way through tunes by, among others, Led Zeppelin, King Crimson and Kylie Minogue. Never has this monster instrument been put through its paces with quite such determination. (In German, \"Schrott\" means \"scrap metal\".) <strong>DG</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Gerry Mulligan/Art Farmer</strong> In Stockholm and Hollywood (Solar)</p><p>Mulligan's baritone sax and Farmer's trumpet make perfect partners. With only bass and drums for accompaniment, the interplay between them is a joy to hear, combining lightness with intensity. These rare live recordings date from 1959, when both men were at their peak. <strong>DG</strong></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n      <a href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n          <img src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\"></img>\n      </a>\n    </div><img alt='' src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Hidden+gems+of+2010%3A+the+pop%2C+world+and+jazz+CDs+you+may+have+missed+Article+1494996&ch=Music&c2=&c4=Pop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CFolk+music+%28Music+genre%29%2CWorld+music+%28Music+genre%29%2CJazz+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&c3=The+Observer&c6=Kitty+Empire%2C+Neil+Spencer+and+Dave+Gelly&c7=10-Dec-19&c8=1494996&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2010/dec/19/overlooked-cds-2010-pop-world|2010-12-20T14:15:19Z|f6c968c0d76f8fac5d60c8d6574cb9a18e08926c -->","PublicationDate":"2010-12-19T00:05:33","ReviewType":{},"StarRating":null,"WebUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/dec/19/overlooked-cds-2010-pop-world","Thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2010/12/15/1292436319957/dylan-003.jpg","Id":113},{"MusicTypes":[{"Id":1}],"Title":"Tannhäuser; Bach Cantata Pilgrimage – review","StandFirst":"Royal Opera House, London; Cadogan Hall, London","TrailText":"Royal Opera debutant Christian Gerhaher steals the show in the Royal Opera's Tannhäuser, says <strong>Fiona Maddocks</strong>","Body":"<p>Bring on the dancing girls! No command appears more frivolous or unlikely for the opening of a weighty, four-and-a-half-hour Wagner opera. Yet as the preludial music to <strong>Tannhäuser</strong> grows ever more orgiastic, a wanton ballet is precisely what's called for and, in the Royal Opera's first new production since 1984, outstandingly conducted by Semyon Bychkov, offers one of its most striking achievements.</p><p>Disporting themselves on or around a huge dining-table-cum-altar-of-love – this is, after all, the Venusberg – a dozen athletic dancers move with increasing bacchic frenzy, never putting a nimble limb wrong. At the visual climax, brilliantly co-ordinating with Wagner's score in Jasmin Vardimon's choreography, they stretch across the table and scissor their legs in the air like a phalanx of unsynched windscreen wipers trying to fight off a monsoon. The image is unforgettable.</p><p>This early work, which Wagner revised constantly until it gathered the accretions of all his later styles, has a reputation for being troublesome. Its relative rarity, compared with the rest of the main Wagner canon, reflects uncertainties about versions – Dresden (1845) or Paris (1861) or a mix of the two? – as well as subject matter. The central conflict – Tannhäuser's painful dithering between the sensual life and the spiritual – is scarcely new. Saint Augustine of Hippo got there long before with his desperate: \"Lord, give me chastity and continence – but not quite yet!\"</p><p>But the way Wagner handles this dilemma is decidedly odd. He zooms in on it in close-up so it becomes almost abstract. Though the synopsis covers two pages in the programme, there's virtually no supporting action. Tim Albery, who also directed the Royal Opera's new <em>Flying Dutchman</em> last year, handles this cleverly by ignoring Wagner's naturalistic instructions. At the start, Tannhäuser, a medieval singer and poet sung by South African tenor Johan Botha, sits waiting for curtain up at the opera, in Michael Levine's designs a replica of Covent Garden's own crimson and gold proscenium arch.</p><p>This theatre-within-a-theatre scheme provides an effective image of decline throughout the three acts, until nearly all traces of structure and gilding have vanished. The perfect fantasy world of theatre is equated with the Venusberg, with Venus herself the glittering diva assoluta. Once the poet tears himself away from her devouring embrace, pleading for fresh air and a life of struggle – though she gives him a pretty hard time as it is – he finds himself back home in the rigid society of the Wartburg. The good and frankly dull Elisabeth, no less demanding after her fashion, awaits him. You can understand his indecision.</p><p>Against a black backdrop, Albery and Levine, with lighting design by David Finn, have Balkanised the Wartburg. The solution is neither radical nor tame, but a workable context for telling the story. Women wear headscarves and drab coats over long skirts. Tannhäuser and his fellow singers crash into this bleak, grey world in their dinner jackets as if from a late night at Annabel's. Indeed, throughout the opera you can chart the hero's moral health by whether he has his bow tie on or off. There's no dress code on the Mount of Venus.</p><p>Botha's acting style is resolutely stand-and-deliver but his voice sounds refulgent and effortless. From the strong cast, it was a Royal Opera debutant who stole the limelight: German baritone Christian Gerhaher won loudest cheers for his tender, intelligent Wolfram. Michaela Schuster's Venus, dressed in silver sheath, had brazen energy and Eva-Maria Westbroek was assured, but not quite at her finest as Elisabeth. The Dutch soprano was mesmerising in the ROH's <em>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk </em>(2006), and will star in the premiere of Mark-Anthony Turnage's <em>Anna Nicole</em> later this season. She may be best at bad women.</p><p>The musicians in the pit, as well as the resplendent chorus on stage, deserve high praise. Wagner divides and subdivides his orchestral sections, with no place to hide. Whether vital, sexy Venusberg violas, solemn Pilgrim-hymn trombones or urgent, contrapuntal woodwind, the Royal Opera orchestra rose to the challenge. Bychkov, who made a prolonged study of <em>Lohengrin</em> before a definitive recording, has now turned his perceptive gaze on <em>Tannhäuser</em>, opting for the Paris version. The music is often described as \"uneven\" but here achieved a propulsive drive and coherence.</p><p>Pilgrimage, across half Europe and as far as New York but inexplicably omitting the Venusberg, has been uppermost in the activities of Sir John Eliot Gardiner and his <strong>English Baroque Soloists and Monteverdi Choir</strong> since they set out on Christmas Day 1999 to perform all Bach's church cantatas in one year, on the liturgical feast days for which they were written. Since then, with the establishment of their own impeccably presented Soli Deo Gloria CD label, the Monteverdis have released them judiciously to a Bach-hungry public.</p><p>Last week, the inspired enterprise drew to a close with a final concert of Advent cantatas at Cadogan Hall culminating in a joyful BWV 140 \"Wachet auf\". With expert timing, <em>Gramophone </em>magazine had just voted the Monteverdi Choir best vocal ensemble in the world. As the last \"alleluia\" rang out, not a soul would disagree.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n      <a href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n          <img src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\"></img>\n      </a>\n    </div><img alt='' src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Tannh%C3%A4user%3B+Bach+Cantata+Pilgrimage+%E2%80%93+review+Article+1494958&ch=Music&c2=&c4=Richard+Wagner%2COpera+%28Music+genre%29%2CJS+Bach%2CClassical+music+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&c3=The+Observer&c6=Fiona+Maddocks&c7=10-Dec-19&c8=1494958&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2010/dec/19/tannhauser-royal-opera-maddocks-review|2010-12-20T14:15:19Z|986fe3b1465754779b6cd1a7c6b2a43d78f347e3 -->","PublicationDate":"2010-12-19T00:05:30","ReviewType":{},"StarRating":null,"WebUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/dec/19/tannhauser-royal-opera-maddocks-review","Thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2010/12/15/1292432838996/Tannhauser-003.jpg","Id":112},{"MusicTypes":[{"Id":1}],"Title":"Scottish Ensemble – review","StandFirst":"Queen's Hall, Edinburgh","TrailText":"Janáček's string quartet based on Tolstoy's The Kreutzer Sonata is a tempestuous affair – and Jonathan Morton's take on it was more than a little rough, too, says <strong>Kate Molleson</strong>","Body":"<!-- Redistribution rights for this field are unavailable -->","PublicationDate":"2010-12-17T22:45:00","ReviewType":{},"StarRating":3,"WebUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/dec/17/scottish-ensemble-review","Thumbnail":null,"Id":69},{"MusicTypes":[{"Id":5}],"Title":"Ke$ha – review","StandFirst":"Shepherd's Bush Empire, London","TrailText":"The bargain-basement Lady Gaga's trashy electro-pop may be obvious, but her live show is a blast, writes <strong>Ian Gittins</strong>","Body":"<p>It's easy to dismiss Ke$ha as a Primark take on Lady Gaga, but such an appraisal disregards the fact that 23-year-old Kesha Sebert this year enjoyed a No 1 US album with her platinum-selling debut, Animal. She has reacted to her success by rushing out an \"augmented\" version of her album, Animal + Cannibal, which she is currently promoting via this whistle-stop European tour.</p><p>The record is a cartoon collection of paeans to getting wasted and getting laid squeaked via Autotune over relentless thumping cheesy dance beats, and Ke$ha makes it clear to her mostly female, mainly teenage audience that she is here to party. Glam-trashy in turquoise lipstick and gold hotpants, she sets the tone with the spectacularly asinine Party at a Rich Dude's House, ending its tales of pissing in Dom Perignon and throwing up in closets with a cartwheel of sheer exuberance.</p><p>Her music is crashingly obvious sledgehammer electro-pop topped with unsubtle innuendo, like Britney on a budget, but that doesn't stop her live show being fantastic fun and dumbly compelling. Sebert spends much of the evening wrestling her band and rolling on the floor, particularly during Dinosaur, a bitchy put-down of ageing suitors (\"You are an old man/Go have a CAT scan\") and Backstabber, which could be Gossip Girl fronting a punk-pop band and is perfect for anybody who finds Katy Perry too nuanced and calibrated.</p><p>She closes with the carnal techno throb of US mega-hit Tik Tok and bounces back flanked by drag queens waving blow-up dolls for an encore romp through the Beastie Boys' Fight for Your Right to Party, a song that succinctly encapsulates her ethos, despite being written before she was born. Ke$ha Sebert's brat-pop will have a short shelf life, but her moment is now.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n      <a href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n          <img src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\" alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\"></img>\n      </a>\n    </div><img alt='' src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Ke%24ha+%E2%80%93+review+Article+1496145&ch=Music&c2=&c4=Kesha%2CPop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Ian+Gittins&c7=10-Dec-17&c8=1496145&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2010/dec/17/kesha-review|2010-12-20T14:15:18Z|704e0f7c0eac748c64e950b08a5cf6e6e20fa934 -->","PublicationDate":"2010-12-17T22:15:00","ReviewType":{},"StarRating":4,"WebUrl":"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/dec/17/kesha-review","Thumbnail":null,"Id":63}]
