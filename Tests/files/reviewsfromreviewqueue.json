The drum sound alone seems to come via the Mersey tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eColdplay\u0027s last album, Vive le Vida, suggests they may now be the world\u0027s biggest-selling band, and while U2 and the Stones may still be ahead in tour receipts, Martin\u0027s troops are a formidable live act. The £50 tickets (unfortunately touted for 15 times as much) get you a set of greatest hits and songs they haven\u0027t played in years, and an evening somewhere between Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Elton John and Anfield. In My Place raises hands in the air within 30 seconds; the crowd bellow Yellow so loudly Martin can barely get a word in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWearing unfeasibly tight trousers and a carnation, the thirtysomething singer is part consummate frontman, part someone stumbling on stage at a wedding party. On record, he can be overearnest; live, he is a hoot, smashing mic stands, accidentally headbutting the microphone, claiming to be listening to Radio 4 through his headphones, and insisting the band are too embarrassed to play anything from their forthcoming fifth album because it is \\\"atrocious\\\". However, they can unleash considerable emotion, not least when the crowd form a hushed choir as Fix You unshowily but poignantly captures the point of the evening.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMartin may wish to come over like a hapless Mr Bean, but he clearly has powers beyond even the average rock god. \\\"If only the pantomime genie could magic up the greatest songwriter in Britain,\\\" he sighs, and lo and behold on walks Take That\u0027s Gary Barlow for a version of Back for Good, which generates such hysteria you fear for the building. The surreal cast is then joined by Peter Kay, hurling sweets, and no fewer than three Elvises, playing violins.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut perhaps the most significant moment came earlier, when the Choir With No Name – singers of varying ability drawn from \\\"the fringes of society\\\" – brought cheers to the rafters with their heroic, moving renditions of Christmas classics. Meanwhile, the £250,000 raised by these gigs has already established a Crisis centre in Liverpool: while governments do nothing, or worse, it seems that extraordinary events such as this can make a real difference to struggling people\u0027s lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMore information at \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"http://crisis.org.uk\\\" title=\\\"\\\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ecrisis.org.uk\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"gu_advert\\\"\u003e\\n      \u003ca href=\\\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\\\"\u003e\\n          \u003cimg src=\\\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\\\" alt=\\\"Ads by The Guardian\\\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\\n      \u003c/a\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg alt=\u0027\u0027 src=\u0027http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Coldplay+%E2%80%93+review+Article+1496736&ch=Music&c2=&c4=Coldplay%2CPop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Dave+Simpson&c7=10-Dec-20&c8=1496736&c9=Article\u0027 width=\u00271\u0027 height=\u00271\u0027 /\u003e\u003c!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2010/dec/20/coldplay-review|2010-12-20T14:15:20Z|559f4a3e95239079e9fc080dfec906bc6af3625b --\u003e\",\"PublicationDate\":\"\\/Date(1292849424000+0000)\\/\",\"ReviewType\":{},\"StarRating\":4,\"WebUrl\":\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/dec/20/coldplay-review\",\"Thumbnail\":null,\"Id\":134},{\"MusicTypes\":[{\"Id\":5}],\"Title\":\"Saint Etienne – review\",\"StandFirst\":\"Forum, London\",\"TrailText\":\"Cracknell, Stanley and Wiggs rustled up some Christmas magic despite a melancholic chill in the air, writes \u003cstrong\u003eCaroline Sullivan\u003c/strong\u003e\",\"Body\":\"\u003cp\u003eSaint Etienne played their last show of the year on the kind of London night that probably inspired some of their songs: fresh snowfall had already turned into sooty slush, and outside the Forum a group of under-dressed smokers looked grimly stoic. Inside, where the temperature had just about hit double figures, the trio took their time coming on stage, and who could blame them? If we\u0027re to believe the sleevenotes to their new festive album, A Glimpse of Stocking, they are wholehearted fans of Christmas, but the atmosphere approximated that melancholy hour late on 25 December when the festivities are indubitably over.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSomehow, though, between the three of them – plus achingly high-spirited video footage of 1960s London, which was the starting point for their sound back in 1990 – a bit of Yuletide magic was achieved. True to previous form, sequin-skirted Sarah Cracknell made a fairly tepid frontwoman, and synth-players Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs were anonymous silhouettes in the shadows behind her. But the sweet kick of the music, with its sweeping strings and icing-sugar melodies, was enormously seductive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe set was full of hits (they\u0027ve had more than you\u0027d think, from the deceptively lightweight Only Love Can Break Your Heart to the incongruously Latinate Like a Motorway) but it was the lesser-knowns that really registered. Girl VII proved a showpiece as Cracknell recited a list of the capital\u0027s least glamorous places (\\\"Old Ford, Kennington, Dollis Hill\\\") over a flute-filled tune that could have come from a 70s travelogue; new single DJ picked and probed at the bones of late-80s trance, complete with footage of overly refreshed ravers. Chris Rea\u0027s Driving Home for Christmas and their own I Was Born on Christmas Day (\\\"Julian Assange was going to sing on this, but he couldn\u0027t make it,\\\" Cracknell joked feebly) made a satisfying ending to an evening of low-key pleasures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"gu_advert\\\"\u003e\\n      \u003ca href=\\\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\\\"\u003e\\n          \u003cimg src=\\\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\\\" alt=\\\"Ads by The Guardian\\\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\\n      \u003c/a\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg alt=\u0027\u0027 src=\u0027http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Saint+Etienne+%E2%80%93+review+Article+1496516&ch=Music&c2=&c4=Saint+Etienne%2CPop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CIndie+%28music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Caroline+Sullivan&c7=10-Dec-19&c8=1496516&c9=Article\u0027 width=\u00271\u0027 height=\u00271\u0027 /\u003e\u003c!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2010/dec/19/saint-etienne-review|2010-12-20T14:15:20Z|cafd8e77a370461ff0db47b61c02bc63b073b747 --\u003e\",\"PublicationDate\":\"\\/Date(1292797802000+0000)\\/\",\"ReviewType\":{},\"StarRating\":4,\"WebUrl\":\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/dec/19/saint-etienne-review\",\"Thumbnail\":null,\"Id\":130},{\"MusicTypes\":[{\"Id\":1}],\"Title\":\"The Sixteen/Christophers – review\",\"StandFirst\":\"Barbican Hall, London\",\"TrailText\":\"Conductor and choir were bristling with as much energy as ever, but this Messiah took time to settle, writes \u003cstrong\u003eMartin Kettle\u003c/strong\u003e\",\"Body\":\"\u003cp\u003eOne can imagine a more dramatic Messiah than Harry Christophers and the Sixteen provided in the Barbican\u0027s rather dry acoustic, but across large stretches of Handel\u0027s great score it would be hard to imagine a more beautiful one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot that Christophers is an ascetic. Far from it. His Messiah always bristles with dancing energy, as well as unfolding organically from one number into the next. There were plenty of expressive and even romantic gestures in this account, too, typified by some rather soupy phrasing in the overture and by a very striking broadening of the first syllable of the \\\"Wonderful\\\" outburst in&nbsp;For Unto Us a Child Is Born. And Christophers always has a trump card in the shape of his outstanding chorus – 18 of them rather than 16 – whose warm sound and technical security provided the rock upon which Messiah rests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor all the conductor\u0027s cajolings, this Messiah took time to settle. The first part of Handel\u0027s oratorio had many fine moments, among which James Gilchrist\u0027s compellingly deliberate Comfort Ye and a scintillating Rejoice Greatly from the substitute soprano Sophie Bevan stood out. But it was not until part two, the core of the work depicting Christ\u0027s Passion and Resurrection, that the reading consistently transcended its individual numbers. Catherine Wyn-Rogers set the standard for the rest to follow with a grippingly impassioned He Was Despised, and was matched by Gilchrist\u0027s hugely engaged accounts of Christ\u0027s torments, before the corner was turned and the chorus\u0027s pivotal Lift Up Your Hearts carried things irresistibly through to the Hallelujah Chorus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePart three did not quite succeed in maintaining this tremendously high level throughout. But Christopher Purves grabbed his moment with an irresistibly stentorian The Trumpet Shall Sound, and Handel\u0027s supreme final pages, from Worthy Is the Lamb to the Amen, were wonderfully done, bringing a tingle to the spine and a tear to the eye, as ever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"gu_advert\\\"\u003e\\n      \u003ca href=\\\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\\\"\u003e\\n          \u003cimg src=\\\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\\\" alt=\\\"Ads by The Guardian\\\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\\n      \u003c/a\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg alt=\u0027\u0027 src=\u0027http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=The+Sixteen%2FChristophers+%E2%80%93+review+Article+1496507&ch=Music&c2=&c4=Classical+music+%28Music+genre%29%2CGeorge+Frideric+Handel%2CMusic%2CCulture&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Martin+Kettle&c7=10-Dec-19&c8=1496507&c9=Article\u0027 width=\u00271\u0027 height=\u00271\u0027 /\u003e\u003c!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2010/dec/19/the-sixteen-christophers-review|2010-12-20T14:15:20Z|a919e65d72851faa9ba22f06c61b99ea74279c9f --\u003e\",\"PublicationDate\":\"\\/Date(1292795100000+0000)\\/\",\"ReviewType\":{},\"StarRating\":4,\"WebUrl\":\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/dec/19/the-sixteen-christophers-review\",\"Thumbnail\":null,\"Id\":127},{\"MusicTypes\":[{\"Id\":5},{\"Id\":8}],\"Title\":\"Michael Jackson: The Experience – review\",\"StandFirst\":\"(Wii, Ubisoft, cert: 12, out now)\",\"TrailText\":\"\u003cp\u003eA Michael Jackson dancing game celebrating the late King of Pop will appeal mainly to his fans, writes \u003cstrong\u003eWill Freeman\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\",\"Body\":\"\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0027re a fan, it\u0027s unlikely \u003cem\u003eMichael Jackson: The Experience\u003c/em\u003e will do anything but delight.

No command appears more frivolous or unlikely for the opening of a weighty, four-and-a-half-hour Wagner opera. Yet as the preludial music to \u003cstrong\u003eTannhäuser\u003c/strong\u003e grows ever more orgiastic, a wanton ballet is precisely what\u0027s called for and, in the Royal Opera\u0027s first new production since 1984, outstandingly conducted by Semyon Bychkov, offers one of its most striking achievements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDisporting themselves on or around a huge dining-table-cum-altar-of-love – this is, after all, the Venusberg – a dozen athletic dancers move with increasing bacchic frenzy, never putting a nimble limb wrong. At the visual climax, brilliantly co-ordinating with Wagner\u0027s score in Jasmin Vardimon\u0027s choreography, they stretch across the table and scissor their legs in the air like a phalanx of unsynched windscreen wipers trying to fight off a monsoon. The image is unforgettable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis early work, which Wagner revised constantly until it gathered the accretions of all his later styles, has a reputation for being troublesome. Its relative rarity, compared with the rest of the main Wagner canon, reflects uncertainties about versions – Dresden (1845) or Paris (1861) or a mix of the two? – as well as subject matter. The central conflict – Tannhäuser\u0027s painful dithering between the sensual life and the spiritual – is scarcely new. Saint Augustine of Hippo got there long before with his desperate: \\\"Lord, give me chastity and continence – but not quite yet!\\\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the way Wagner handles this dilemma is decidedly odd. He zooms in on it in close-up so it becomes almost abstract. Though the synopsis covers two pages in the programme, there\u0027s virtually no supporting action. Tim Albery, who also directed the Royal Opera\u0027s new \u003cem\u003eFlying Dutchman\u003c/em\u003e last year, handles this cleverly by ignoring Wagner\u0027s naturalistic instructions. At the start, Tannhäuser, a medieval singer and poet sung by South African tenor Johan Botha, sits waiting for curtain up at the opera, in Michael Levine\u0027s designs a replica of Covent Garden\u0027s own crimson and gold proscenium arch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis theatre-within-a-theatre scheme provides an effective image of decline throughout the three acts, until nearly all traces of structure and gilding have vanished. The perfect fantasy world of theatre is equated with the Venusberg, with Venus herself the glittering diva assoluta. Once the poet tears himself away from her devouring embrace, pleading for fresh air and a life of struggle – though she gives him a pretty hard time as it is – he finds himself back home in the rigid society of the Wartburg. The good and frankly dull Elisabeth, no less demanding after her fashion, awaits him. You can understand his indecision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgainst a black backdrop, Albery and Levine, with lighting design by David Finn, have Balkanised the Wartburg. The solution is neither radical nor tame, but a workable context for telling the story. Women wear headscarves and drab coats over long skirts. Tannhäuser and his fellow singers crash into this bleak, grey world in their dinner jackets as if from a late night at Annabel\u0027s. Indeed, throughout the opera you can chart the hero\u0027s moral health by whether he has his bow tie on or off. There\u0027s no dress code on the Mount of Venus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBotha\u0027s acting style is resolutely stand-and-deliver but his voice sounds refulgent and effortless. From the strong cast, it was a Royal Opera debutant who stole the limelight: German baritone Christian Gerhaher won loudest cheers for his tender, intelligent Wolfram. Michaela Schuster\u0027s Venus, dressed in silver sheath, had brazen energy and Eva-Maria Westbroek was assured, but not quite at her finest as Elisabeth. The Dutch soprano was mesmerising in the ROH\u0027s \u003cem\u003eLady Macbeth of Mtsensk \u003c/em\u003e(2006), and will star in the premiere of Mark-Anthony Turnage\u0027s \u003cem\u003eAnna Nicole\u003c/em\u003e later this season. She may be best at bad women.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe musicians in the pit, as well as the resplendent chorus on stage, deserve high praise. Wagner divides and subdivides his orchestral sections, with no place to hide. Whether vital, sexy Venusberg violas, solemn Pilgrim-hymn trombones or urgent, contrapuntal woodwind, the Royal Opera orchestra rose to the challenge. Bychkov, who made a prolonged study of \u003cem\u003eLohengrin\u003c/em\u003e before a definitive recording, has now turned his perceptive gaze on \u003cem\u003eTannhäuser\u003c/em\u003e, opting for the Paris version. The music is often described as \\\"uneven\\\" but here achieved a propulsive drive and coherence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePilgrimage, across half Europe and as far as New York but inexplicably omitting the Venusberg, has been uppermost in the activities of Sir John Eliot Gardiner and his \u003cstrong\u003eEnglish Baroque Soloists and Monteverdi Choir\u003c/strong\u003e since they set out on Christmas Day 1999 to perform all Bach\u0027s church cantatas in one year, on the liturgical feast days for which they were written. Since then, with the establishment of their own impeccably presented Soli Deo Gloria CD label, the Monteverdis have released them judiciously to a Bach-hungry public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast week, the inspired enterprise drew to a close with a final concert of Advent cantatas at Cadogan Hall culminating in a joyful BWV 140 \\\"Wachet auf\\\". With expert timing, \u003cem\u003eGramophone \u003c/em\u003emagazine had just voted the Monteverdi Choir best vocal ensemble in the world.

Glam-trashy in turquoise lipstick and gold hotpants, she sets the tone with the spectacularly asinine Party at a Rich Dude\u0027s House, ending its tales of pissing in Dom Perignon and throwing up in closets with a cartwheel of sheer exuberance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer music is crashingly obvious sledgehammer electro-pop topped with unsubtle innuendo, like Britney on a budget, but that doesn\u0027t stop her live show being fantastic fun and dumbly compelling. Sebert spends much of the evening wrestling her band and rolling on the floor, particularly during Dinosaur, a bitchy put-down of ageing suitors (\\\"You are an old man/Go have a CAT scan\\\") and Backstabber, which could be Gossip Girl fronting a punk-pop band and is perfect for anybody who finds Katy Perry too nuanced and calibrated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe closes with the carnal techno throb of US mega-hit Tik Tok and bounces back flanked by drag queens waving blow-up dolls for an encore romp through the Beastie Boys\u0027 Fight for Your Right to Party, a song that succinctly encapsulates her ethos, despite being written before she was born. Ke$ha Sebert\u0027s brat-pop will have a short shelf life, but her moment is now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\\\"gu_advert\\\"\u003e\\n      \u003ca href=\\\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\\\"\u003e\\n          \u003cimg src=\\\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\\\" alt=\\\"Ads by The Guardian\\\"\u003e\u003c/img\u003e\\n      \u003c/a\u003e\\n    \u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg alt=\u0027\u0027 src=\u0027http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-apidev/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Ke%24ha+%E2%80%93+review+Article+1496145&ch=Music&c2=&c4=Kesha%2CPop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Ian+Gittins&c7=10-Dec-17&c8=1496145&c9=Article\u0027 width=\u00271\u0027 height=\u00271\u0027 /\u003e\u003c!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2010/dec/17/kesha-review|2010-12-20T14:15:18Z|704e0f7c0eac748c64e950b08a5cf6e6e20fa934 --\u003e\",\"PublicationDate\":\"\\/Date(1292624100000+0000)\\/\",\"ReviewType\":{},\"StarRating\":4,\"WebUrl\":\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/dec/17/kesha-review\",\"Thumbnail\":null,\"Id\":63}]"
